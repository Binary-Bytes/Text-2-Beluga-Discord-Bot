Krek:
I don't know.$^1

Billy:
ha$^1
knew it$^1.5

Krek:
I see that.$^1
Let me improve my previous answer.$^1
The term Idk refers to the phrase 'I don't know'.$^2

Billy:
...$^0.5
who asked?$^1

Krek:
You just di-$^1

Billy:
nope$^1

Krek:
...$^0.5
You know what? See this.$^1
The phrase "who asked" is meant to sound sarcastic$^1.5
as in to say nobody actually asked or some imaginary$^1.5
guy asked, i.e.$^2.5

Krek:
So, who asked? = Imaginary$^1
But the square root of -1 is also = Imaginary$^1
That means, who asked = Imaginary = Square root of -1 = i$^1.5
Hence, who asked? = i asked$^1.5

Billy:
...$^0.5
but$^1
does that mean youre imaginary?$^1

Krek:
what?$^1

Billy:
you just said so$^1
"That means, who asked = **Imaginary** = Square root of -1 = i"$^1.5
so youre imaginary?$^1

Krek:
no thats not how it wor-$^1
wait$^1
